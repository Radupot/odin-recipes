    <h2> Preparation</h2>
        <ol> 
            <li><b>Heat Oil</b>: Add oil to a deep pot—about 1-2 inches full-and heat oil to 350 degrees F. The <b> oil temperature is key to success:</b> Make sure the oil is at the right temperature. Use a thermometer to monitor the oil temp (at least 350 and no higher than 375). If the oil is too hot, the fish wont cook fast enough before the coating is overly crisp. If the oil is not hot enough, the coating will be soggy/soft instead of crisp. Also, <b> don't overcrowd the pot,</b> which can lower the oil temp, and keep the coating from crisping.</li>

            <li><b> Prepare Fish</b>: Depending on the size and shape of your fillets, cut them into strips that are long and at least 1 inch wide. Lay the fish fillets on a paper towel and pat dry. Season them generously with sea salt and pepper and then dredge each filet in a little bit of flour.</li>

            <li><b>Make Batter</b>: In a large bowl, mix the flour, cornstarch, baking powder, paprika, salt and pepper. Whisk in the beer (or club soda) to the flour mixture and continue mixing until you have a slightly thick, smooth batter. If it's too thick, add a little more beer.</li>

            <li><b>Batter and Fry</b>: Check oil temperature to make sure it's about 350 degrees F. Dip prepared fillets into the batter and use a spoon if needed to help coat the entire fillet. Working in small batches so you don't overcrowd the pans, carefully lower a few dipped fillets at a time into the hot oil. Fry for approximately 5-7 minutes, turning occasionally, until the batter is crisp and golden and the fish is perfectly cooked. I like to cook just one at the beginning to get an estimated cook time, before cooking more. You don't want to overcook the fish! Keep in mind the fish will continue to cook a little more as it cools off on the paper towel.</li>

            <li>(If you have any <b>leftover batter</b>, you could also dip and fry onion rings, calamari, or shrimp!)</li>

            <li><b>Rest</b>: Once cooked, remove the fillets from the hot oil and drain on paper towels. You can keep the cooked fish warm in a 200 degree oven while you cook it all, if you want.</li>

            <li><b>Serve</b>: Use the same pot of hot oil to make French Fries, or make my Baked French Fries or Air Fryer French Fries. Serve with homemade tartar sauce (it can be made days ahead of time!) and malt vinegar, for dipping.</li>
